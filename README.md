# Secure Password Generator

Secure Password Generator made with python generate a stronge password, copy it to clipboard and save passwords to .csv file.

## How to use
- first download the script with.
```
git clone https://github.com/mohammed-saleh2007/spg
```

- then run the code.

```
cd spg
python3 main.py

## Notes

- for linux users you must have `xclip` installed if you use Xorg or `wl-clipboard` if you use wayland
that to be able to copy generated password to clipboard.

- generated .csv file encryption will be added soon.

- I will seperate the copy function to other project as it works for me not like other ways I found in tutorials **you can say from scratch**.
