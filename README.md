# Secure Password Generator

Secure Password Generator with python generate a stronge password, copy it to clipboard and save passwords to .csv file 

## How to use
- first download the script with
```
git clone https://github.com/mohammed-saleh2007/spg
```

- then run the code

```
cd spg
python3 main.py
```
## Notes

- for linux users you need to have `xclip` if you use XOrg to be able to copy generated password

- if you want to encrypt the .csv file use this script 'UNDER CONSTRUCTION'

- may I will seperate the copy function to other project as it works for me not like other ways I found in tutorials **you can say from scratch**
